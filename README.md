### A feature-rich Jenkins client for iOS

This is the `JenkinsiOS` source code repository. For information about contributing, please visit [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), for a general overview of the application's architecture and structure, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/mobilabsolutions/jenkins-ios/wiki).

`JenkinsiOS` was created in inspiration of [MobiLab](www.mobilabsolutions.com)'s Jenkins client for Android (which can be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobilabsolutions.jenkins.app)) and supports various common Jenkins tasks, including but not limited to: inspecting jobs, builds as well as test results, triggering builds with and without parameters and performing actions such as restarting on a Jenkins instance.

To install `JenkinsiOS`, either get it from the app store (where it will be released soon) or simply clone this project and run it. You will, however, have to replace certain values in [`Config.plist`](JenkinsiOS/Config.plist) to be able to use the application.
