# Contributing

We are always very happy to receive contributions of any kind (but especially code contributions). If you have any questions regarding contributing that cannot be answered referring to this guide, please send us an email or message at [jenkinsios@mobilabsolutions.com](mailto:jenkinsios@mobilabsolutions.com) with the subject line `JenkinsiOS contributing question: ` + your subject.

## Code Contributions

Code contributions are very much appreciated (especially those that add to our test suite). To get a quick start on the application's architecture, please visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/mobilabsolutions/jenkins-ios/wiki).

Before adding any features or fixing any issues, please branch off either `master` and create your own feature branch. Once your feature is developed, please create a pull request onto `master`.

We always try to review pull requests in a very timely manner, however, please be patient if it does take a little longer than you expected.

### Code Conventions

Please do not converge too much from the general code style of the application. It is written in `Swift` and therefore we expect any contributions also to use `Swift` if possible.

Generally, we prefer to use `Storyboards` instead of building our UI in code. Please, if not too inconveniencing, stick to that way of creating your user interfaces.

## Feature Requests and Bugs

If you have a feature request or bug that you would like to report, please use GitHub's issues feature to [create a new issue](https://github.com/mobilabsolutions/jenkins-ios/issues/new) _after_ checking if a similar issue already exists.

## Feedback

If you have any general feedback or questions, please consider sending us an email at [jenkinsios@mobilabsolutions.com](mailto:jenkinsios@mobilabsolutions.com).

However, please report any bugs or direct and concrete feature requests on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mobilabsolutions/jenkins-ios/issues).
